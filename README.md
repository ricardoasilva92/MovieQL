# MovieQL

Nodejs app where you can explore more than 7000 movies and 21000 people (actors, directors or writers). All information is stored in **OWL** format and [sparql-client 2  ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sparql-client-2) is used to query the data in the ontology.
You have two ways to explore, querying in **SPARQL**, or explore interactively using search boxes for movie names, actor names, etc.
